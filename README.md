Hello, I'm XXPolat!
Today I will tell you how a website was crashed.

# Installation

chmod +x ddos_test.py
./ddos_test.py

python3 main.py

# Usage

If you have installed and run our tool, you will be presented with a screen to specify the site you will attack. You can type the URL of any site you want and continue. Then, a screen will appear asking whether you want to attack with or without a proxy (I recommend attacks with a proxy).

That's it, enjoy!
